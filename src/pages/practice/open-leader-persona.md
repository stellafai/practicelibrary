  means to embody the five characteristics of open leadership 


  1. transparency

  The exercise aims to empower participants to apply these principles in their leadership roles, fostering a culture of inclusivity, collaboration, and continuous improvement within their organisation. This will help them to drive positive change and nurture a more transparent and collaborative work environment.

  2. Encourage Application of Open Leadership Principles: The exercise empowers participants to apply the principles of open leadership in their own leadership roles. By creating a persona that embodies these traits, participants are inspired to emulate open leadership behaviors and foster a more inclusive and collaborative work environment.

  3. Foster Collaborative Problem-Solving: Through group discussions and brainstorming, the exercise encourages collaborative problem-solving. Participants work together to identify challenges and potential solutions, leveraging diverse perspectives for more comprehensive and innovative outcomes.

  4. Strengthen Organizational Culture: The exercise promotes the integration of open leadership principles into the organization's culture. It emphasizes transparency, inclusivity, and collaboration as essential values, contributing to a more positive and cohesive work environment.

  5. Empower Participants: By actively involving participants in the creation of the "Open Leadership Persona," the exercise empowers them to take ownership of open leadership principles. Participants feel more accountable for implementing positive changes in their leadership styles and team dynamics.

  6. Drive Continuous Improvement: The exercise reinforces the idea of continuous improvement. As participants identify challenges and behaviors, they are encouraged to seek opportunities for growth and adaptability in their leadership roles.

  7. Inspire Positive Change: Through the creation of actionable personas, the exercise inspires participants to take concrete steps towards becoming open leaders. It motivates them to lead with transparency, empathy, and inclusivity, ultimately driving positive change within the organization.
