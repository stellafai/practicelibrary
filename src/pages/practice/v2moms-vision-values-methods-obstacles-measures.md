whatIs: >-
  V2MOMs stand for Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures.


  A similar framework to MSPOT, V2MOMs work well to enable communication of strategy, especially when you need really strong top-down alignment.
whyDo: >-
  V2MOMs can bring multiple benefits to an organisation:


  * **Enhanced Clarity of Purpose:** By creating the vision for a particular goal, an understanding is created of how individual work ties into the overall purpose.

  * **Seamless Alignment Across the Organisation:** In creating the vision and values, you are forced to see how your individual and team's work fits into the organisation as a whole.

  * **Sharper Focus on Strategic Initiatives:** Leveraging this framework is a great way to stay on top of strategic initiatives. It helps teams link their strategic initiatives into documents that can be shared across the organisation.
howTo: >-
  The process of V2MOMs: The leadership team creates V2MOM for the company, and
  then functional leaders create V2MOMs for their teams.


  * The five items are:

    * **Vision:** Big-picture goal
    * **Values:** Things that are important to you
    * **Methods:** Actions needed to achieve the goal, in priority order
    * **Obstacles:** Challenges you need to overcome to achieve the goal
    * **Measures:** Measurable results indicating progress toward the goal
