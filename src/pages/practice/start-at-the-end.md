  Start At The End is a simple exercise to identify key assumptions that must be tested 
  to achieve customer success goals. It asks CS teams to describe what successful 
  customer outcomes look like, and use this to define their success strategies. We 
  typically look 12 months ahead, but it can be shorter or longer depending on customer 
  lifecycle. Then, teams imagine all the ways customers might fail to achieve success, 
  using these insights to identify key risks and assumptions that must be examined 
  early. At the end of the exercise, you will have:

  * A shared understanding of what customer success looks like for your key segments

  * A list of critical assumptions about customer adoption, retention, and growth that 
    need to be validated early

  * A prioritized set of success metrics and leading indicators to track

whyDo: >-
  * Most CS planning activities focus on managing a "list of activities" rather than 
    driving measurable customer outcomes. Start At The End helps teams put customer 
    success at the center of their work and identify assumptions that could lead to 
    churn or missed expansion opportunities.

  * Start At The End is quick to facilitate but yields valuable insights. It's great 
    for CS leaders who are new to facilitating workshops or teams that need to 
    quickly align on customer success goals.

  * This activity helps CS teams envision what successful customer outcomes look like 
    and build proactive strategies to achieve them.

  ### Tips

  * When defining what success looks like, it may be helpful to focus on goal setting from the perspective of the customer and business.  Identify what value or success looks likes for your customer.  Then define what value you are looking to achieve for your business.  


  * The technique forces participants to think about failure, which many teams never do. It's surprising how much you can learn about a domain just by getting participants to share their fears. 


  * It's easy to communicate the results of the session in slide ware and project rooms. We'd recommend keeping the results up in the project space throughout your effort.


  ### Who do you need?

  * Facilitator

  * Product Owner

  * Project Sponsor, both technical and business

  * Architects


  ### Suggested Time

  * 1-2 hours. The session can be done without any participant prep.


  ### Difficulty

  * Facilitator: Easy

  * Participants: Easy


  ### Facilitation Materials Needed

  * None required, but 3x5 sticky notes with markers can be useful if you want participants to jot their notes down independently and then present back.


  ### How does it fit?

  * Typically done in the Why area of the Discovery of the Open Practice Library

## What is it?

Start At The End is a simple exercise to identify key assumptions that must be tested 
to achieve customer success goals. It asks CS teams to describe what successful 
customer outcomes look like, and use this to define their success strategies. We 
typically look 12 months ahead, but it can be shorter or longer depending on customer 
lifecycle. Then, teams imagine all the ways customers might fail to achieve success, 
using these insights to identify key risks and assumptions that must be examined 
early. At the end of the exercise, you will have:

- A shared understanding of what customer success looks like for your key segments
- A list of critical assumptions about customer adoption, retention, and growth that 
  need to be validated early
- A prioritized set of success metrics and leading indicators to track

## Why use Start At The End?

- Most CS planning activities focus on managing a "list of activities" rather than 
  driving measurable customer outcomes. Start At The End helps teams put customer 
  success at the center of their work and identify assumptions that could lead to 
  churn or missed expansion opportunities.
- Start At The End is quick to facilitate but yields valuable insights. It's great 
  for CS leaders who are new to facilitating workshops or teams that need to 
  quickly align on customer success goals.
- This activity helps CS teams envision what successful customer outcomes look like 
  and build proactive strategies to achieve them.

## Tips

- When defining what success looks like, it may be helpful to focus on goal setting from the perspective of the customer and business. Identify what value or success looks likes for your customer. Then define what value you are looking to achieve for your business.
- The technique forces participants to think about failure, which many teams never do. It's surprising how much you can learn about a domain just by getting participants to share their fears.
- It's easy to communicate the results of the session in slide ware and project rooms. We'd recommend keeping the results up in the project space throughout your effort.

## Tips for Remote Working

- Remote facilitation doesn't differ much from the face to face, but you need to be more clear on the preparation of the draft Target outcome prepared before the working session is starting, by your Product Owner
- Prepare in advance a template on a whiteboard tool with title and steps and be crystal clear about what you expect providing examples
- Use the timer visible to all attendees
- Start with the Start at the end and apply the Affinity Map practice below to group topics
- At the end you can review the Target outcomes of your initiative and write a SMART GOAL that can become the starting point of Impact Map or the Open Decision Tree

## Related Practices

- [Impact Mapping](/practice/impact-mapping/) is another practice which leads to the same outputs. Compared to Start At The End, Impact Mapping produces a higher fidelity understanding of the domain, but at the cost of increased complexity for facilitation. Generally speaking, Impact Mapping is the better fit when building products or services, and Start At The End is a better fit when discussing organizational change or other generally nebulous efforts.

## Who do you need?
