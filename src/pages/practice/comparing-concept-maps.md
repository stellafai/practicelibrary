whatIs: This is a short whole-team activity to uncover differences in how people
  think about the project they are working on or the problem they are trying to
  solve. As the accompanying image shows, a concept map (here, of a public
  library, originally drawn by Amy Hodge) shows the key ideas making up
  someone's mental model and (crucially) the relationships between those ideas
  as well.
whyDo: "It can be healthy for different members of a team to have different
  mental models of the problem domain: for example, DevOps or Marketing may
  think about the software in a different way than Development. However,
  contradictions between different team members' mental models can also be a
  source of friction, and missing elements or connections in models can lead to
  oversights."
howTo: >-
  1. Each team member spends 5 minutes drawing a small concept map of what the
  team is working on. Team members do this separately and without looking at
  each other's work.

  2. On the count of 3-2-1, team members reveal their concept maps to each other.

  3. The meeting moderator then leads a discussion of differences between those concept maps.


  This exercise is particularly useful for new team members at the end of their second or third week of onboarding, and again at the end of their first quarter.

people: 3 or more. The meeting moderator may be one of the participants (i.e.,
  may draw a concept map as well).
time: 5 minutes to draw concept maps, 10-30 minutes to compare depending on team
  size and how similar/different they are.
difficulty: easy
participants: []
