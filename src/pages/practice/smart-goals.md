  Smart Goals are a goal-setting framework coined by George T. Doran In 1981.
  George published a paper called, “There’s a SMART Way to Write Management’s
  Goals and Objectives.” In the document, he introduced SMART goals as a
  framework to help improve the chances of succeeding in accomplishing a goal.


  A SMART goal should be:


  1. Specific

  2. Measurable

  3. Attainable

  4. Realistic

  5. Time-related


  SMART goals are more of a guideline than a framework. They are ‘what’ focused, rather than ‘how’ focused.

  Setting SMART objectives ensures that your goals hit the key criteria to keep
  them moving forward and make progress.


  1. Specific - Ensures that everyone understands what the goal is

  2. Measurable - Everyone understands how progress towards this will be measured

  3. Attainable - This goal relates to me and my specific circumstances

  4. Realistic - This goal isn’t out of reach and can be achieved

  5. Time-related - There’s a dedicated time frame so this goal isn’t open-ended

  T﻿o set SMART goals, you need to ensure that any goal you draft hits the 5
  criteria of a SMART goal. An example of the construction of a SMART goal is: 


  **V1 Goal**: Better typing


  **Make it Specific**: Increase typing speed.


  **Now make it Measurable**: Increase typing speed to 100 wpm


  **How do we make this Attainable**: Increase my typing speed to 100 wpm


  **Hmm.. now actually Realistic**: Increase my typing speed from 50 to 75 wpm


  **And how long will we give this (time-based)**: Increase my typing speed from 50 to 75 wpm in 3 months
