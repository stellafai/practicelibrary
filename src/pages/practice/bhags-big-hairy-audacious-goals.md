  BHAGs stands for Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals. A BHAG is a compelling,
  long-term goal that can inspire and motivate groups of people to take action,
  with urgency.


  BHAGs are a long-term (10-30 years) goal that defines the essence of a team’s existence. They complement shorter-term goals frameworks (3-12m).
whyDo: A BHAG is clear and compelling, needs little explanation; people get it
  right away. They can be used to inspire organisations and provide a huge
  target for an organisation to hit.
howTo: >-
  There are four categories that can guide the creation of BHAGs:


  * **Role Model:** Role model BHAGs involve selecting a role model (usually another business/ organisation) and seeking to emulate their traits and success e.g. Facebook

  * **Common Enemy:** Common enemy BHAGs involve David vs Goliath motivation - with the focus being to ‘defeat a common enemy’. Collins and Porras cite the examples of Nike’s 1960s mission to “Crush Adidas”

  * **Targeting**: As the word implies, a target BHAG involves setting a huge, clear, definable target e.g. Walmart.

  * **Internal Transformation:** Remain competitive by revitalising. Focused internally rather than externally, internal transformation BHAGs seek to transform your company from within.e.g. Apple in 90s


  **Example: The Moon landing** 


  On 25 May 1961 JFK stated "that this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth”. No need for a verbose speech or document, the world understood: the U.S. would put a man on the moon—and bring him back safely.
