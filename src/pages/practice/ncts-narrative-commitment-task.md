  This framework stands for Narrative, Commitment, and Task.


  These can help when Product Teams are working on ambiguous initiatives and need more context


  * **Narrative**: 1-2 sentence qualitative description of what the team want to achieve in Qtr (a wordier Objective)

  * **Commitments**: 3-5 measurable goals that ‘pod’ commit to by a specific date (like Key Results)

  * **Tasks**: Defining the work that needs to be done in order to achieve commitment. Can be changed in cycle.
whyDo: NCTs aim to give more context around goals as to ‘why’ they were defined.
  This is done to provide the team with more motivation, as well as to encourage
  a more realistic goal-setting mindset. Which can be easily lost in a very
  laser-focused environment.
howTo: >-
  T﻿he best way to write your NCTs is to follow the framework: 


  * **Narrative**: Write a 1-2 sentence qualitative description of what the team want to achieve in the quarter

  * **Commitments**: Draft 3-5 measurable goals that ‘pod’ commit to by a specific date

  * **Tasks**: Define the work that needs to be done in order to achieve commitment. This can be changed in the cycle. 




  **Example: Trip Advisor**


  *Narrative*: to increase the share of traffic coming directly to the product, rather than SEO and SEM.


  *Commitments*:


  1. Increase the number of unique savers by 10% by the end of Q1

  2. Launch the enhanced "Save to Trip" feature

  3. CTAs to 25% of traffic by mid-Feb


  *Tasks*:


  * Add a modal to announce the "Saves to Trip" feature to returning users

  * Add a prominent save CTA to the hotel’s list page

  * Add a tooltip to the more prominent save CTAs for users who have not previously used the feature
