We love that you want to contribute to this practice library!

This project is a downstream curated version of the [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/).

We periodically sync this library with the latest changes from the upstream Open Practice Library.

Except where noted, content on this site is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Just like the code for the Open Practice Library, the code for this version of the practice library has an open source Apache 2.0 license and is available [here](https://github.com/stellafai/practicelibrary).

You may even want to consider creating your own curated practice library for your own organisation. This is what friend and coach to Stellafai, Jeremy Brown, did to create [Jeremy's Practice Library](https://www.jeremybrown.tech/practicelibrary/). Stellafai actually forked Jeremy's version as their baseline (thanks Jeremy!).

## Adding a Practice that already exists in the Open Practice Library

As this is a curated version of the upstream Open Practice Library we've removed some of the practices, please [get in touch with us](https://www.stellafai.com/contact/) if you think we should include it. We would be very happy to work with you to include the practice.

## Adding a Practice to the Open Practice Library

The Open Practice Library is where all new practices should be added. Their [contribution guide](https://openpracticelibrary.com/page/contribution-guide/) explains how to add a practice.

It is really easy, no coding required.

Once you have your practice added feel free to [contact us](https://www.stellafai.com/contact/) if you want your practice added here too. All practices add here will also be available to use in the [Stellafai application](https://app.stellafai.com)

## Updating or Editing a Practice

The Open Practice Library, and by extension this practice library, benefits hugely from contributions. Your contributions can include:
- Edits for spelling and grammar,
- Pictures and screenshots of you using the practice,
- Links to great articles and videos about the practice,
- And most importantly, improvements to the article itself.

If you've made changes to an upstream practice which we have in this library, our period syncs should pick them up, if you are really keen to have your change accepted right away please do [contact us](https://www.stellafai.com/contact/).

### Note: All the links to "Improve this Practice" and the button below to "Start Now" are to the upstream [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/)
