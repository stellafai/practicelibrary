I love that you want to contribute to this practice library!

This project is a downstream curated version of the [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/).

I periodically sync this library with the latest changes from the upstream Open Practice Library.

Except where noted, content on this site is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Just like the code for the Open Practice Library, the code for this version of the practice library has an open source Apache 2.0 license and is available [here](https://github.com/tenfourty/practicelibrary), feel free to poke around, fork it and even contribute to improve my hacks.

## Adding a Practice that already exists in the Open Practice Library

As this is a curated version of the upstream Open Practice Library I've removed some of the practices, please [get in touch with me](https://www.jeremybrown.tech/contact/) if you think I should include it. I would be very happy to work with you to include the practice.

## Adding a Practice to the Open Practice Library

The Open Practice Library is where all new practices should be added. Their [contribution guide](https://openpracticelibrary.com/page/contribution-guide/) explains how to add a practice.

It is really easy, no coding required.

Once you have your practice added feel free to [contact me](https://www.jeremybrown.tech/contact/) if you want your practice added here too.

## Updating or Editing a Practice

The Open Practice Library, and by extension this practice library, benefits hugely from contributions. Your contributions can include:
- Edits for spelling and grammar,
- Pictures and screenshots of you using the practice,
- Links to great articles and videos about the practice,
- And most importantly, improvements to the article itself.

If you've made changes to an upstream practice which I have in this library my period syncs should pick them up, if you are really keen to have your change accepted right away please do [contact me](https://www.jeremybrown.tech/contact/).
