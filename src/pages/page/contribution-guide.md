I love that you want to contribute to this practice library!

This project is a downstream curated version of the [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/), so that is the best place to start. Their [contribution guide](https://openpracticelibrary.com/page/contribution-guide/) explains how to add a practice.

## Adding a Practice that already exists in the Open Practice Library

As this is a curated version of the upstream Open Practice Library I've removed some of the practices, please [get in touch with me](https://www.jeremybrown.tech/contact/) if you think I should include it. I would be very happy to work with you to include the practice.
