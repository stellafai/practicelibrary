    The Stellafai Practice Library is an opinionated collection of practices designed to influence human behaviors that drive customer success and impact business results (also called outcomes). These practices are organized around the Mobius Loop model, which helps determine the appropriate context for each practice.

    As Stellafai coaches, we created this library for individuals interested in understanding and adopting our Customer Success Operating System.

    In our application and coaching, we often reference methods that enhance team performance and foster customer and organizational success. Many of these methods are cataloged in the Open Practice Library, with numerous articles contributed by Stellafai coaches. The Open Practice Library is a vast and vibrant collection, enriched over the years by a diverse community of contributors. We are deeply proud of this achievement, as the Open Practice Library also reflects the work many of our coaches participated in during their time at Red Hatâ€™s Open Innovation Labs.

    However, we recognized the need for a more focused subset of practices tailored specifically for customer success. This curated collection aligns with how we work and coach teams to achieve alignment, focus, connection, and measurable customer success outcomes.    </Typography>
