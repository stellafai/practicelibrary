    This is an opinionated collection of practices aimed at changing human behaviours which drive customer-success and impact business results (also called outcomes). They are organised around the Mobius Loop model, which helps us navigate when to use each practice.

    We, Stellafai coaches, built this for people interested in understanding and adopting our Customer Success Operating System.

    In our application and during our coaching, we often reference methods that drive high performance in teams and customer and organisational success. These methods are all catalogiued in the Open Practice Library (with many articles contributed by Stellafai coaches). The Open Practice Library is a collection of many different practices, quite an overwhelming collection of them in fact. This is because of the vibrant community of folks that have contributed over the years. We remain hugely proud of this since the Open Practice Library is a result of the work many of our coaches did was part of in Red Hat's Open Innovation Labs.

    We wanted to create a more opinionated subset of practices that are focussed on the use case of customer success and we feel are relevant to the way we work and how we coach teams to align, focus connect and measure customer success outcomes.
